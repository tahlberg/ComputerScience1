All code is subject to change.
Project is using the LPC Graphics Library developed by Colin Schatz.

Function references are subject to rework as development continues.
Not all variables and functions are currently in use.
Code may contain cout commands to act as checks to verify crash locations and whether or not functions are correctly modifying data.

Known Bugs:
  Graphics Window crashes upon launch.
  StartGraphics function fails to properly run (the check cout does not print anything)
  If player stats do properly generate, the player health is 0.
  
 To-Do:
  Finish graphics implementation
  Overhaul function reference using the new Game struct
  Implement button function to allow user input
  Boss graphics?
  Rebalance attacks and boss
  Death screen with vector of bosses killed.
